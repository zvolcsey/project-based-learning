> **Source:** ChatGPT (OpenAI)

This document outlines the planned improvements for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game to enhance functionality and demonstrate key programming concepts for interview preparation.

## 1. Input Validation
- [x] Implement error handling to ensure the player inputs 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.
- [x] Prompt the user again if the input is invalid.
- **Goal:** Handle invalid input gracefully.

## 2. Modularization with Functions
- [ ] Refactor the game into separate functions:
  - [ ] `get_player_choice()`
  - [ ] `get_computer_choice()`
  - [ ] `determine_winner()`
- **Goal:** Improve readability, reusability, and organization of the code.

## 3. Optimize Winner Determination
- [ ] Use a data structure like a dictionary or tuple to map winning combinations.
- **Goal:** Reduce redundancy and improve algorithm efficiency.

## 4. Replay Feature
- [ ] Allow the player to play multiple rounds with an option to exit.
- **Goal:** Implement a game loop to enhance user experience.

## 5. Score Tracking
- [ ] Keep track of the player’s and computer’s scores across multiple rounds.
- **Goal:** Maintain game state and provide ongoing feedback to the user.

## 6. Cryptographic Randomness Explanation
- [ ] Be prepared to explain the use of `secrets.choice()` for the computer’s random choice.
- **Goal:** Demonstrate an understanding of randomness and security concerns in programming.

## 7. Documentation and Comments
- [x] Add clear comments explaining each function and logic block.
- **Goal:** Ensure code maintainability and readability.

## 8. Unit Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for key functions using `unittest` or `pytest`.
- **Goal:** Showcase knowledge of testing and ensure the correctness of the code.
